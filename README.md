Lab sessions and past exams of the course Machine Learning from the Master programme in Artificial Intelligence, University of Bologna.
The notebooks cover some of the core concepts of Machine Learning, such as data exploration and preprocessing, classification, regression and clustering. We also studied the less common topic of association rules.
